## About

The STAC API defines a RESTful JSON-based server to browse and query [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs](stac-spec/) 
(STAC). While the core STAC specification provides a structure and language to describe assets, users usually want to access
a subset of the entire catalog, such as for a certain date range, in a particular area of interest, or matching properties
they care about. STAC API extensions specifies those query parameters, and compliant servers return collections of STAC Items that
match the user's preferences. A lot of additional functionality can added through the [OGC API](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/) family of
standards, particularly [OGC API - Features](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html) (OAFeat, for our
shorthand). 
As STAC APIs follow a RESTful model, a core principal of this is the use of HTTP Request Methods ("verbs") and
the `Content-Type` header to drive behavior on resources ("nouns").

## Overview

The [core](core/) of STAC API simply returns a valid [STAC Catalog](stac-spec/catalog-spec/catalog-spec.md) and a description
of what parts of the fuller STAC API specification it conforms to. The `links` section of the Catalog is the jumping
off point for the more powerful capabilities - it contains a list of URL's, each described by particular link 
'relationships' (`rel`) to indicate their functionality. Note that the [STAC Core specification](stac-spec) provides 
most all the content of API responses - the STAC API is primarily concerned with the return of STAC 
[Items](stac-spec/item-spec/README.md) and [Collections](stac-spec/collection-spec/README.md) through API functionality.

There are then three major sets of functionality that build on the core, which are designed to be complementary, letting
implementations choose which parts they want to utilize. Most every STAC API implements at least one, and many follow
two or all three.

### Item Search

The [item search](item-search) functionality is one of the most common, provided by the `search` rel often 
located at a `/search` endpoint. It re-uses all of the OAFeat [query 
parameters](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_items_) specified in their 'core', and adds a 
couple more. It does not require a full implementation of OAFeat, it is instead a simplified construct that can run a 
search across any set of indexed STAC [`Items`](stac-spec/item-spec/README.md). 

### Collections

The other most common set of functionality is [Collections](collections/). It is linked to with the `data` 
relationship, and lives at the `/collections` endpoint/. The response is a complete list of available STAC 'Collections', 
along with the requirement to have `/collection/{collectionId}` endpoints to request each collection individually, by ID. 
This general pattern is  defined in OAFeat's [Feature Collections](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_collections_), 
but STAC is currently just using a subset of the full OAFeat conformance class, so for now it is specified here.
STAC's [Collection](stac-spec/collection-spec/README.md) extends the OGC Collection with a handful of [additional 
fields](stac-spec/collection-spec/collection-spec.md#collection-fields). STAC API's are expected to return STAC
compliant Collections.

### OGC API - Features

The final major functionality for a STAC API is to [provide individual `item` query endpoints](ogcapi-features/) 
for each collection. Some STAC API implementations only describe their Collections, without providing search of individual 
Items, indeed they may not have Items. Many implementations go further than just providing the `search` rel by becoming fully compliant with
[OGC API - Features Core](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_requirements_class_core), implementing
following their [GeoJSON](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_requirements_class_geojson) and 
[OpenAPI](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_requirements_class_openapi_3_0) options, as STAC 
is always in GeoJSON and OpenAPI is used to specify STAC API. Full compliance involves splitting STAC `Items` into
individual `/collections/{collectionId}/items` endpoints that expose querying single collections, as OAFeat does
not currently allow cross-collection search. And it adds a few other requirements, which are highlighted in the 
[features description](ogcapi-features/), in order to help STAC implementors understand OAFeat without having to
read the full spec from scratch.

### Extensions

Both STAC API and OAFeat allow 'extensions' that can be added for additional functionality.
We are working to fully merge the extensions, so that every STAC extension is specified at the OGC API level, and
STAC API just presents a curated set of extension options. 

## Capabilities List

The following table describes the service resources available in a full STAC API implementation. Note that the 'Endpoint'
column is more of an example in most cases. OGC API makes some endpoint locations required, those will be bolded below.

| Endpoint                                        | Link Relationship  | Returns                                           | Description |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `/`                                             | root               | [Catalog](stac-spec/catalog-spec/catalog-spec.md) | Extends `/` from OAFeat to return a full STAC catalog. |
| `/search`                                       | search             | ItemCollection | Retrieves a group of Items matching the provided search predicates, probably containing search metadata from the `search` extension |
| **`/collections`**                                  | data               | JSON           | Object with a list of Collections contained in the catalog and links |
| **`/conformance`**                              | conformance        | JSON | Info about standards to which the API conforms |
| `/api`                                          | service-desc       | OpenAPI 3.0 JSON | The OpenAPI definition of the endpoints in this service            |
| **`/collections/{collectionId}`**               | collection         | Collection     | Returns single Collection JSON |
| **`/collections/{collectionId}/items`**         | items                   | ItemCollection | GeoJSON FeatureCollection-conformant entity of Items in collection |
| **`/collections/{collectionId}/items/{featureId}`** | Item           | Returns single Item (GeoJSON Feature) |

## Conformance Classes

STAC API is evolving to utilize OAFeat's 
'[Conformance](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_declaration_of_conformance_classes)' JSON structure. For 
STAC API 1.0.0-beta.1 we declare new STAC Conformance classes, and specify which OAFeat ones to use. These are detailed in the relevant
sections below.The core STAC conformance classes communicate the conformance JSON only in the root (`/`) document, while OGC API 
requires they also live at the `/conformance` endpoint. 

**NOTE:** *By 1.0.0 we aim to have requirements classes specified in detail, as testable assertions, 
like OGC does, but for now the core reference is just this spec document and the OpenAPI yaml. We also desire to have the
URI's for conformance to actually resolve to machine-readable information clients can use.*	

## STAC Core and OGC Versions

This version of STAC API depends on OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core [Version 1.0](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html),
and on [OGC API - Commons - Part 2: Collections](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/blob/cc8ca2f011d7e1b19721268c4bf2b97c163d160a/20-024.pdf)
from the [August 18 V2 Commit](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/tree/cc8ca2f011d7e1b19721268c4bf2b97c163d160a/collections) 
(we hope they will publish at least a 'beta' version that we can point to soon).

This version of STAC API is intended to work with any STAC core specification version 0.9.x or 1.x.x (included betas), but is not 
designed to work with STAC 2.0 and above (since we use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) it may introduce backwards incompatible changes). 
The STAC API spec is released with the latest stable STAC core specification version included in the [`/stac-spec`](stac-spec/) 
directory as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). To determine which version it is just check the 
[`/stac-spec/CHANGELOG.md`](stac-spec/CHANGELOG.md) for the topmost version & release date.

## STAC API 

The STAC API is broken up into a number of discrete parts, specified by 'Conformance Classes'. The only one required to be considered
a valid STAC API is 'STAC API Core', but the majority of implementations will implement at least 'STAC Search' or 'Commons Collections'. 
A majority of the conformance classes are defined by OGC (Commons and OAFeat), and the number will likely increase as OGC capabilities 
expand and STAC works to align.
